## Chapter 6: Challenge 6

## Title: Kinetic Energy

### Exercise Description:

In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy. The following formula can be used to determine a moving object’s kinetic energy:

𝐾𝐸 = 1/2 𝑚𝑣<sup>2</sup>

The variables in the formula are as follows: _KE_ is the kinetic energy, _m_ is the object’s mass in kilograms, and _v_ is the object’s velocity, in meters per second.

Write a function named`kineticEnergy`that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. The function should return the amount of kinetic energy that the object has. Demonstrate the function by calling it in a program that asks the user to enter values for
mass and velocity.

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

We must provide to the Compiler the same switches that we usually do in the IDE:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name

Enter the mass (Kg): 12
Enter the velocity (m/s): 3
The Kinetic Energy (KE) of the object is equal to 54.00 joules.
Would you like to keep calculating the Kinetic Energy (y/n)? y
Enter the mass (Kg): -4
You must type a number greater or equal than 0.00. Try again!
Enter the mass (Kg): 23243
Enter the velocity (m/s): 344
The Kinetic Energy (KE) of the object is equal to 1,375,241,824.00 joules.
Would you like to keep calculating the Kinetic Energy (y/n)? n
  
Process finished with exit code 0
reinier@reinier %
